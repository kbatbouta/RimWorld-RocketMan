### RocketRules (Compatibility system)

RocketMan support a new rule system to avoid compatibility issues.
This works by placing `RocketRules.xml` files in `YourModFolder/Extras/RocketRules.xml`

### Request and notification system
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<RocketRules>
     <Notify type="PawnDirty" packageId="krkr.RocketMan" method="ThingWithComps:Notify_Equipped"/>
</RocketRules>
```
Your mod can notify RocketMan to clear the statCache by calling a function in your code (preferably not empty due to patching limitations). You can follow this format
* `packageId` is your mod `packageId`. This is used only to keep track of the current rules.
* `method` (formated as `YourClass:Method`) is the method that you call to notify rocketman that your mod need the cache cleared.

**Note** This works by applying a `Prefix` patch on the destination/provided method (in this case `ThingWithComps:Notify_Equipped`) thus every time you call `ThingWithComps:Notify_Equipped` in this example the prefix is executed and the cache is cleared.
and that prefix notify rocketman to clear the cache

**Note** The destination/provided method should have something in it otherwise patching it may not be possible

**Notification types**
* `PawnDirty` The target/provided method for this need to have `Pawn pawn` as a parameter. 

**Note on notification types** For now there is only one which is `PawnDirty`. This system is the new way forword for your mod to call RocketMan regardless of the load order.
